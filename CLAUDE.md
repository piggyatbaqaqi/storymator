* Every new module foo.py needs a pytest-compatible foo_test.py that exercises every function and method. Run each new test module and confirm that all tests in it pass.
* Python code formatting follows PEP-8.
* All new code gets PEP 484 and PEP 526 type annotation. New code needs to pass mypy type checking.
* New markdown documents live in docs/ unless otherwise requested.
* Functional tests live in tests/ and need not be pytest compatible.
* All pulldown menus use react-select.
* Check every change into git with useful comments.
* Every program in bin that generates a redis key should be added to the bin/rebuild_redis script.
* A missing package on production is a packaging error.
* Update docs/api-reference.md every time we change REST APIs.
* Priority order of CLI parameters is CLI --<parameter>, environment variable <PARAMETER>, config file (if we have one), and finally hardcoded default.
* `bin/` CLIs parse strictly: build the parser with `parents=[common_parser()]` and call `parse_args()`, then `get_env_config(cli_args=args)` — never `parse_known_args()` (it silently swallows typo'd flags). Justify any deliberate subprocess passthrough with a `# pragma: argparse-passthrough` comment. Single-use flags stay out of `common_parser()`. See `docs/bin-argparse-strict.md`.
* Changes are made with TDD. Write tests first, get them confirmed by a human, commit to git, and then make the test pass with an implementation.
* When failing tests are checked into git, they get pytest xfail tags so the head always has all tests passing--this allows bisect bug searches.
* A correllary of the last two constraints is that we need to implement bare skeletons of implementations so that there's enough to import--we can not xfail an import failure.
* Whenever we create a new CouchDB database, please update docs/couchdbs.md.
* Programs that are needed for one time fixes go in fixes/ rather than bin/.
* Please don't check credentials (especially passwords) into git.
* Keep wheel versions and their corresponding deb versions in sync.
* Prompt me about writing a skill if you see the same basic procedure happening at least 3 times.
* Detector work: pathology + poster-child cases live in `tests/fixtures/pathologies.json` with prose narrative in `docs/data_quality_production_v4_model.md`. Every taxon referenced in the memo needs a fixture entry. Conventions and walkthrough in `tests/fixtures/README.md`.
* Fix preexisting mypy and flake8 fixes when you find them. Make sure the fixes are in their own commit.
* State the disposition of every finding: what was recorded (class or identifier), where (file and section), and the commit. A git hash alone is not a disposition.
* The disposition covers everything reported in that response. Name anything you chose not to record, with the rationale.
